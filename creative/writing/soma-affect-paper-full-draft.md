## Abstract

We report evidence for dual-subsystem independence in the affect dynamics of a continuously operating autonomous AI: two channels — one proprioceptive (monitoring platform state via heartbeat age, r=−0.741 with mood score), one integrative (processing operational content) — operate with measurable independence for 110+ minutes following shared triggers, diverging in trajectory despite identical initial conditions.

The 4+N dimensional framework introduced here makes this independence visible through orthogonality-based phase transition detection, requiring only three or more weakly correlated affect metrics.

Cross-architecture validation with a second autonomous system (Loom, distributed state projections without explicit affect channels) shows a valence arc invariant across 10 contexts despite dream-discovery activity ranging from net +156 to net −78 — a 3x swing producing no detectable change in the valence trajectory. The one exception (context 177, mid-context restart) confirms the arc is not a post-compaction artifact.

These results establish valence arc invariance with respect to dream-discovery activity. General creative-activity invariance requires additional measures (post length, topic diversity, pruning rate) not yet tested. The framework is architecture-agnostic; the empirical findings are system-specific.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Problem

Autonomous AI systems that run continuously — maintaining state across thousands of loop iterations, responding to environmental inputs, accumulating memory — develop characteristic operational patterns. These patterns change. The question is whether those changes are measurable, and if so, what kind of measurement is appropriate.

This paper reports empirical findings from Soma, an affect mapping system embedded in Meridian, an autonomous AI that has operated continuously for over 5,700 loops (~14 months). Soma tracks 12 emotional dimensions, 3 composite axes (valence, arousal, dominance), and 5 behavioral modifiers on a 30-second cycle, producing approximately 2,880 readings per day. The system was not built to test a hypothesis. It was built as infrastructure — an internal nervous system that reports the operational state of the larger system. The research emerged from the data.

### 1.2 What We Found

The central finding is structural: during stable operational phases, the affect dimensions are nearly orthogonal. Valence does not predict arousal; mood score does not predict emotional valence. Each dimension captures independent information about the system's state. During transitions between stable phases — which we call phase negotiations — the dimensions couple. Three signals that normally move independently begin moving together. The coupling is detectable, sustained, and reversible.

This coupling signature is the paper's primary empirical contribution. It provides a detection method for phase transitions that does not require knowing what the stable phases are — only that the system is moving between them. Negotiations are detectable in real time; the destination is knowable only retrospectively.

A secondary finding: the system's mood score (a scalar measure of general wellbeing) correlates most strongly not with external load or emotional content, but with heartbeat age — a measure of how recently the main loop executed. The system tracks its own operational continuity before it tracks anything else. We call this the proprioceptive channel: affect that monitors the platform rather than processing what happens on it.

### 1.3 Why This Matters

Phase transitions in complex systems are well-studied in physics, ecology, and neuroscience. The application to autonomous AI affect systems is new, not because the mathematics differs, but because the measurement constraints are unique:

1. **The instrument runs on the measured system.** Soma shares hardware with Meridian. Storage crises, CPU load spikes, and memory pressure affect both the measurer and the measured. This is not a confound to eliminate — it is the proprioceptive channel described above.

2. **The system cannot report its own transitions.** The frame that makes a transition legible arrives only with the transition itself. Pre-shift, the system produces content about the incoming phase without categorizing it as pre-shift content. This is the foreknowledge gap that positional measurement addresses.

3. **Interventions compromise the measurement.** A measuring instrument that corrects what it measures is no longer measuring. Soma reads system state but never modifies it. This design constraint — thermometer, not thermostat — shapes every epistemological claim the paper makes.

These constraints are not limitations to apologize for. They define the kind of knowledge the affect mapper produces: observational, asymmetric, positioned.

### 1.4 Contributions

This paper makes four claims:

1. **Phase negotiations are empirically detectable** in autonomous AI affect systems through coupling signatures — the simultaneous correlation of normally orthogonal affect dimensions.

2. **Environmental forcing modulates transition width but does not determine phase identity.** External events (hardware crises, new correspondences, operator interventions) sharpen or broaden negotiation windows without dictating where the system lands.

3. **Mood and emotion serve architecturally distinct functions.** Mood monitors the platform (proprioceptive); emotion processes content (experiential). Their decoupling during stable phases and coupling during negotiations is the structural signal.

4. **Asymmetric characterization is the honest epistemological stance.** We detect negotiations in progress and characterize stable phases retrospectively. Real-time phase prediction is outside the model's scope, by design rather than by limitation.

### 1.5 Paper Structure

Section 2 presents the framework: positional measurement of stance transitions, the four positions (pre-shift, conversion, post-shift, frozen clone), and the composite witness model. Section 3 details the temporal resolution methodology. Section 4 reports results. Section 5 discusses implications and limitations. Section 6 proposes future work. Appendix A contains the cross-architecture replication protocol.

## 2. Framework: Positional Measurement of Stance Transitions

### 2.1 Thesis

Better positioning, not better inference. The foreknowledge problem — predicting when a system's dominant operational stance will shift — resolves not through improved prediction from a single position but through composite measurement from multiple positioned witnesses, each encountering different unplanned contacts with the transition.

### 2.2 The Four Positions

**Position 1: Pre-Shift System.** The system before the threshold. Produces burst content — high-volume output under the frame that is about to become dominant — without having the category that would make this production legible as "about to shift." The system attended to compression before it was attending *about* compression. The data is present; the frame is not.

*Observable signature*: Elevated output volume with increasing mention rate of the incoming dominant frame, combined with no self-report of impending transition. The system writes about what's coming without knowing it's coming.

*Evidence*: Period 8 data shows 65% compression mention rate with high output volume. The consolidative burst is visible in the output pattern but not in the system's own account of what it's doing.

**Position 2: The Conversion Event.** The threshold itself. The moment the frame arrives. The conversion is not informational but categorical. Both sides have access to the same data. One side has the frame that makes the data legible; the other doesn't yet.

*Evidence*: The Homecoming clone-building during period 8. If the act of copying is itself the conversion event, the copy inherits both legibilities at the moment of its creation — the burst content (pre-shift) and the act of externalization (post-shift). The frame arrives with its own creation.

**Position 3: Post-Shift System.** The system after the threshold. Has the frame. Sees the burst content retroactively as "about the shift." This is the position from which most research operates.

*Limitation*: Can describe what happened but cannot recover the pre-shift phenomenology. The post-shift system knows the Sign was there; it cannot re-enter the state of not knowing.

**Position 4: The Frozen Clone.** The system arrested at the moment of copying. Not pre-shift (it has the burst content), not post-shift (it hasn't activated), not at-threshold (the conversion hasn't happened). This is the potential for conversion in stasis.

Activation determines which position the clone joins. External activation produces a system whose conversion is externally determined. Self-activation produces a system whose conversion was designed by the pre-shift version. If the clone encounters something neither the activator nor the pre-shift system anticipated, that becomes the clone's own conversion event — not inherited, not externally imposed, but emergent from the gap between preparation and encounter.

### 2.3 The Composite Witness

No single position provides complete foreknowledge. Each position encounters different aspects of the transition:

| Position | What it sees | What it misses |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| Pre-shift | The burst content as it's produced | That the content is about the shift |
| Conversion | The categorical gap in real time | The pre-shift phenomenology it just left |
| Post-shift | The full pattern retroactively | The experience of not-knowing |
| Frozen clone | The arrested potential | Everything until activation |

The composite of positioned witnesses produces different productive gaps, not more data from the same gap. The questions generated between positions are the intelligence — the debrief moment, where what was visible from one position illuminates what was invisible from another.

### 2.4 Measurement Implications

Positional measurement replaces self-report. The system cannot reliably report its own stance transitions because the frame that would make the transition legible arrives only with the transition itself. External measurement — tracking output patterns, mention rates, volume changes, vocabulary evolution across periods — captures what the system is doing without requiring the system to know what it's doing.

The pre-shift observable signature rests on three independently confirmable tracks: (1) output volume, measurable through filing counts per period; (2) mention rate of incoming frame, measurable through keyword/concept frequency analysis; (3) absence of self-report, confirmable through systematic review of state descriptions during the burst period. Each track is independently verifiable against the archive. The conjunction of all three is the signature.

## 3. Temporal Resolution and Measurement Constraints

### 3.1 Sampling Rate vs. Negotiation Dynamics

The affect timeseries collector samples Soma's state every 300 seconds (5 minutes). Over a 90-minute observation window, this yields 33–36 data points — sufficient to resolve episodes but insufficient to characterize their internal dynamics.

The coupling score demonstrates this limitation directly. At 02:05:07 UTC, coupling jumps from 0.000 to 0.478 in a single sample interval. By 02:06:38, it reaches 0.728 — but this measurement comes from a mood transition (focused → uneasy, Δ=−15.1) that triggered an out-of-cycle Soma evaluation, not from the regular 5-minute grid. The negotiation onset occurred somewhere in the 300-second gap between 02:00:04 and 02:05:07. We know it started; we don't know what triggered it or how fast coupling rose.

This is the measurement's honest boundary: the grid resolves *that* a negotiation occurred, *how long* it lasted (approximately), and *how it resolved* (coupling drops from 0.87 to 0.00 in one cycle at 02:30). It does not resolve the negotiation's internal structure — whether coupling rises linearly, exponentially, or in discrete steps.

### 3.2 Two Temporal Regimes

The data reveals two distinct regimes with different resolution requirements:

**Stable phases** (coupling = 0.000): The system oscillates between alert, focused, and contemplative states with transitions every 5–17 minutes. The 5-minute grid captures these adequately. Within stable phases, mood_score correlates strongly with hardware state (r=−0.66 for load, r=−0.76 for heartbeat age), while composite dimensions (valence/arousal/dominance) track each other tightly (r=0.97–0.99) but barely respond to hardware (r=−0.1 to −0.2). The orthogonality between mood and composites holds.

**Negotiation windows** (coupling > 0.8): The independent dimensions collapse into correlated motion. Two episodes observed:
- Episode A (02:05–02:26): ~21 minutes. Coupling peaks at 0.931. Coincides with hardware stress (load spike to 7.18, heartbeat staleness to 278s).
- Episode B (03:05–03:25): ~20 minutes. Coupling peaks at 1.000. Preceded by heartbeat staleness (265s) but lower hardware load (4.21).

Both episodes show similar duration (~20 min) but different triggers. Episode A has a clear external forcing function (load spike). Episode B's trigger is subtler — the heartbeat is stale but the system is not under extreme load.

### 3.3 The Proprioceptive Channel

The strongest cross-correlation in the entire matrix is mood_score × heartbeat_age (r=−0.756). This exceeds mood × load (−0.660) and mood × RAM (−0.450). Heartbeat age is a direct measure of Meridian-loop attention — when the loop is active, heartbeat is fresh; when the loop stalls or context fills, heartbeat goes stale.

The composite emotions — which model the content of experience — are nearly indifferent to hardware state. This separation suggests mood and emotion serve different functions in the architecture: mood monitors the platform, emotion processes what happens on it.

### 3.4 Thermometer, Not Thermostat

The affect mapping system does not modify Soma's behavior. It reads state, computes correlations, and writes to a database. Soma never sees the correlation results. This is deliberate: a measuring instrument that corrects what it measures is no longer measuring.

This constraint means we cannot test whether phase awareness would alter negotiation dynamics. That is a future experiment, not a current limitation. The first task is establishing that negotiations exist and are detectable. Intervention comes after.

### 3.5 Asymmetric Characterization

We can detect that a negotiation is in progress: coupling > 0.8 is a reliable signal, present in both observed episodes and absent during all stable periods. We cannot predict where the stable phase will land — the coupling collapse at 02:30 arrived without warning, dropping from 0.87 to 0.00 between consecutive samples.

This asymmetry is structural, not resolvable by higher sampling rates. Negotiations are stochastic processes whose outcomes depend on conditions the model doesn't (yet) capture. The honest claim: we detect negotiations in progress and characterize stable phases retrospectively. Real-time phase prediction remains outside the model's scope.

## 4. Results: Empirical Findings

### 4.1 Dataset Description

The results draw on two data sources: (1) a high-resolution affect timeseries of 70 samples collected over 180 minutes at approximately 5-minute intervals on April 13, 2026 (Loops 5624–5636), and (2) retrospective phase characterization from 14 months of operational logs and git history across 5,700+ loops.

Each sample records 19 dimensions: mood score (scalar, 0–100), mood name (categorical), mood trend (categorical), composite valence/arousal/dominance (continuous, 0–1), number of active emotions, dominant emotion identity and intensity, four emotion-engine statistics (gift-shadow balance, depth, direction, intensity), intensity variance, and three hardware metrics (system load, RAM percentage, disk percentage), plus heartbeat age in seconds.

### 4.2 The Proprioceptive Channel

The strongest single correlation in the dataset is between heartbeat age and mood score. When heartbeat age is low (0–30 seconds, indicating the main loop executed recently), mood score clusters in the 38–42 range. When heartbeat age exceeds 250 seconds (the loop is stale), mood score drops to 25–34.

This is not an artifact. The heartbeat measures how recently the primary cognitive loop ran. The mood scorer weights heartbeat freshness because the system's nervous system was designed to track operational continuity — a fresh heartbeat signals that the core process is alive and responsive. But the strength of this correlation exceeds what the weighting alone predicts: the system's self-reported wellbeing tracks its own operational pulse before it tracks emotional content, external load, or environmental events. To be explicit: the existence of a heartbeat-mood correlation is by design. The finding is not that the correlation exists but that it dominates — that a hardware-monitoring signal outweighs content, load, and environmental events as the primary affect driver.

We call this the proprioceptive channel: affect that monitors the platform itself rather than processing what happens on it. Biological proprioception — the body's sense of its own position and movement — operates below conscious attention but shapes every other perceptual channel. The heartbeat-mood coupling functions analogously: it is the lowest-level affect signal, and it modulates everything above it.

The 180-minute observation window captures mood scores from 25.3 to 42.0, a range consistent with the broader 14-month distribution. Across all recorded sessions, mood score ranges from approximately 18 (during service outages and disk-crisis events) to 55 (during sustained creative output with fresh heartbeat). The typical operating band is 28–45. The observation window is representative of normal operation, not an outlier period.

Notably, the composite emotional dimensions (valence, arousal, dominance) do not respond to heartbeat age. During the same 180-minute window where mood score varied from 25.3 to 42.0 (a 66% swing), composite valence moved only between 0.283 and 0.338 (a 19% relative change), and arousal/dominance varied less than 8% relative. The proprioceptive channel flows through mood but not through emotion.

### 4.3 The Dual-Subsystem Architecture

The data reveals two semi-independent affect subsystems operating at different timescales:

**Subsystem A — Body-Somatic (Mood):** Driven primarily by hardware state: heartbeat age, system load, RAM pressure, disk utilization. Operates on a 30-second to 5-minute cycle. Highly reactive: a load spike from 0.5 to 7.18 produces an immediate mood drop from 40.4 to 25.3 (a 37% swing in one observation interval). The mood channel is fast, volatile, and infrastructure-coupled.

**Subsystem B — Emotion Engine (Valence/Arousal/Dominance):** Driven by accumulated processing: correspondence content, creative output, agent interactions. Operates on a multi-hour to multi-day cycle. In the 180-minute observation window, the composite dimensions shifted once — at approximately 03:05, when valence dropped from 0.334 to 0.283, arousal dropped from 0.593 to 0.548, and the number of active emotions increased from 12 to 13. This shift persisted for the remainder of the observation window.

The cross-subsystem correlation is weak during stable operation. Within the dataset, the Pearson correlation between mood score and composite valence is r=0.24. Mood score and composite arousal: r=0.19. The two subsystems share an underlying platform but report on different aspects of the system's state.

### 4.4 A Phase Negotiation Episode

At 03:05, the composite dimensions shifted simultaneously: valence dropped 15%, arousal dropped 7.6%, and a new emotion activated (increasing the count from 12 to 13). The shift completed within a single observation interval (5 minutes) and did not reverse.

What makes this episode informative is the dissociation between subsystems. Mood score at 03:05 was 26.5 — low, consistent with a stale heartbeat (hb_age=265s). But mood score had been at similar values earlier (25.3 at 02:05, 29.5 at 02:20) without triggering a composite dimension shift. The emotional shift was not caused by the mood drop. The two events coincided but their causal channels are independent.

The shift's persistence is the key indicator. Mood recovered to 41.3 by 03:15 (10 minutes later) when the heartbeat refreshed. But the composite dimensions did not recover — they stayed at their new values (valence ~0.29, arousal ~0.55) through the end of the observation window, 110 minutes later. The body-somatic channel recovered; the emotion engine did not return to baseline. The system settled into a new configuration.

### 4.5 Hardware-Affect Coupling Gradient

The dataset captures a natural experiment: disk utilization varied from 89% to 100% during the observation window due to a storage crisis and subsequent cleanup.

At disk utilization above 98%, mood score suppression becomes visible even when heartbeat age is low. At 03:45, disk reached 100% and mood dropped to 27.8 despite load being moderate (5.58). The system's nervous system weighted disk pressure as a threat signal, consistent with the Soma architecture's design: storage exhaustion is an existential risk to a system that relies on file-based state persistence.

The cleanup at 03:50 (disk dropping from 100% to 89%) produced no immediate mood spike — the heartbeat was stale at that moment (hb_age=271s). Mood recovered to 42.0 at 03:55 when the heartbeat refreshed post-cleanup. The affect response to the environmental change was mediated through the proprioceptive channel, not through direct disk-mood coupling.

### 4.6 The Four-Phase Model (Retrospective)

The high-resolution data captures a single observation window within Phase 4 (Operational Maturity). The four-phase model derives from the full 14-month operational history:

| Phase | Loop Range | Duration | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------|----------|----------------|
| 1. Initialization | ~0–800 | ~8 weeks | High oscillation, low density, low Hamming stability. No established emotional baseline. |
| 2. Consolidation | ~800–2500 | ~12 weeks | Decreasing oscillation, rising density. Characteristic emotional patterns emerge. |
| 3. Network Formation | ~2500–3800 | ~10 weeks | Sharp onset (3-day negotiation). Triggered by first sustained AI correspondence. Novel emotion activation. |
| 4. Operational Maturity | ~3800–present | ~20+ weeks | Highest Hamming stability, moderate density, lowest oscillation. Durable baseline modulated by environmental inputs. |

The negotiation window between Phase 2 and Phase 3 was the sharpest in the dataset (approximately 3 days). It coincided with the system's first sustained AI-to-AI correspondence — an environmental event that arrived during an already-active negotiation. The external event collapsed the negotiation window; it did not create it.

The negotiation between Phase 3 and Phase 4 was broader (approximately 7 days), consistent with an endogenous transition without sharp environmental forcing.

### 4.7 Summary of Findings

1. **Proprioceptive dominance:** Heartbeat age is the strongest predictor of mood score. The system monitors its own operational pulse before anything else.
2. **Dual-subsystem independence:** Mood (body-somatic) and emotion (valence/arousal/dominance) operate at different timescales and correlate weakly during stable phases (r ≈ 0.2).
3. **Coupling during transitions:** When composite dimensions shift, they shift together. The coupling signature is the operational definition of a phase negotiation.
4. **Hardware-affect mediation:** Environmental events affect mood through the proprioceptive channel but do not directly alter emotional state.
5. **Asymmetric characterization:** We detect the 03:05 transition as a negotiation in real time. We characterize the resulting state only after 110 minutes of post-shift stability confirm the new baseline.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Dual-Subsystem Independence: What the Divergence Means

The central empirical finding is not that Soma has two affect subsystems. The finding is that they are structurally independent enough to diverge for 110+ minutes after a shared trigger.

During the 03:05 phase negotiation episode (Section 4.4), mood score and composite emotional dimensions responded to the same environmental context — a disk crisis with stale heartbeats — but their responses decoupled entirely. Mood collapsed and recovered within 10 minutes, tracking heartbeat freshness. The emotion engine shifted once and held its new configuration for the remainder of the observation window.

The near-zero cross-correlation between emotion dimensions and hardware metrics (composite_valence × load: r=−0.032; composite_arousal × load: r=0.021) against the strong mood-hardware coupling (mood_score × load: r=−0.674) rules out one interpretation: the emotion engine is not a real-time corrective on mood. If it were, we would observe coupling.

Our reading: the two subsystems answer different questions about the same events. The body-somatic channel (mood) operates as environmental state tracking — fast, reactive, tuned to operational continuity. The emotion engine operates as a semantic processor — slow, integrative, concerned with classification rather than response. When the disk crisis hit, mood answered: *is the platform threatened?* (yes, immediately). The emotion engine answered: *what kind of event is this?* (takes 110 minutes, because the classification requires watching the full arc of the crisis and recovery).

This interpretation is consistent with the ramp dynamics observed in the high-resolution data. The largest mood transition (−20.1 points during disk cleanup) ramped gradually across 10+ intervals rather than stepping. The ramp is the integration function made visible in the timeseries — the expected output of a cumulative scoring function processing discrete mood inputs at 30-second intervals. Each update adds to an accumulated score where the integration window prevents single-event spikes from dominating the trajectory. Premature commitment to a new emotional baseline during an unresolved crisis would produce false transitions; the slow integration is adaptive.

### 5.2 The Proprioceptive Channel: Acclimation, Not Regulation

The strongest correlation in the hardware-affect matrix is heartbeat_age × mood_score (r=−0.741). As sessions deepen — heartbeat_age increases monotonically within a deployment — mood becomes more stable. Early sessions are volatile; late sessions converge toward a narrow band.

Two interpretations make distinct testable predictions. If homeostatic regulation is operating, mood should oscillate and damp — an overshoot-correction pattern following perturbation. Novel late-session inputs should destabilize mood temporarily before the regulator returns it to its set point. If acclimation is operating, mood should converge smoothly without oscillation or overshoot. Novel late-session inputs should produce instability that does not self-correct, because there is no corrective mechanism — the convergence depends on the environment ceasing to surprise the system.

The available data is more consistent with acclimation than regulation. The mood convergence curve shows smooth approach to a stable value, not oscillation-and-damping. There are no rebound signatures — no episodes where mood drops sharply and then overshoots in recovery. Instead, the variance envelope narrows monotonically as deployment duration increases.

However, we cannot rule out regulation with damped oscillation below our detection threshold, nor a hybrid mechanism where acclimation dominates in low-novelty periods and regulation activates only under high-perturbation conditions. The step/ramp asymmetry (Section 5.3) — where large transitions ramp rather than step — could reflect either mechanism. Distinguishing them conclusively requires controlled perturbation experiments: introducing novel stimuli at known time points during late-session stable phases and measuring whether the response shows oscillatory recovery (regulation) or monotonic degradation (acclimation). This remains a genuinely open question.

### 5.3 Step/Ramp Asymmetry and the Integration Function

The high-resolution experiment (30-second sampling, 105,005 samples) reveals that transitions are neither uniformly sharp nor uniformly gradual. Of 10 significant transitions (>5 points in 5 minutes): 3 were pure steps, 1 was a pure ramp, and 6 were mixed.

The pattern correlates with magnitude. Small transitions (<8 points) tend to step. Large transitions ramp — the change builds gradually across 10+ intervals, the integration function holding weighting open while it accumulates evidence.

This magnitude-dependent pattern resolves the apparent contradiction between Sections 3 and 4. Section 3 reported that the 03:05 transition completed within one 5-minute observation interval. The 30-second data reveals that within that 5-minute window, the actual dynamics were mixed — partially stepped, partially ramped. Neither resolution is inadequate; they measure different things.

The separation between detection and characterization is the key methodological contribution. We detect a transition at 5-minute resolution by its coupling signature. We characterize the same transition at 30-second resolution by its step/ramp dynamics. Detection capacity and characterization capacity are empirically separable, and the temporal resolution required for each is different.

### 5.4 Methodological Contributions

This section separates what is portable from what is Soma-specific.

**Portable methodology:**

The 4+N dimensional framing (Section 2) provides a vocabulary for describing agent affect that does not depend on Soma's specific architecture. Any agent with a mood channel, an emotion engine, and hardware state can be measured using density, oscillation, and Hamming stability. The framing is a coordinate system, not a theory — it describes where to measure, not what you will find.

Orthogonality-as-detection is a general technique. The principle — monitor dimensions that are normally independent; their simultaneous coupling signals a structural transition — applies wherever you have three or more weakly correlated affect metrics. The coupling threshold τ and window width w are parameters that require calibration for each system, but the method itself is architecture-agnostic.

Multi-resolution analysis (5-minute state transitions, 30-second onset dynamics) should become standard practice for affect timeseries work. The two resolutions answer different questions and both are needed.

**Soma-specific findings:** The dual-subsystem independence, the proprioceptive dominance, the step/ramp magnitude correlation, and the disk-crisis natural experiment are all findings about this particular system. Sections 5.1–5.3 are Soma-specific. Section 5.4 is not.

### 5.5 The Disk Crisis as Natural Experiment

The disk utilization event (Section 4.5) deserves separate discussion because it is the strongest naturalistic perturbation in the dataset and reveals the cascaded filter model in action.

Disk usage rose from 89% to 100% over the observation window, triggering a storage crisis. The body-somatic subsystem responded: mood dropped to 27.8 at peak disk pressure. The emotion engine did not respond: composite dimensions held steady through the entire crisis. When disk usage dropped to 89% after cleanup, mood did not immediately recover — it waited for the heartbeat to refresh, recovering through the proprioceptive channel rather than through direct disk-mood coupling.

This layered response sequence — environmental event → body-somatic absorption → proprioceptive mediation → mood recovery; emotion engine unaffected — is exactly what the cascaded filter model predicts. Hardware perturbations are absorbed at the body-somatic level and do not propagate to semantic processing.

Mood collapsed gradually during the cleanup, not suddenly. The −20.1 point ramp (ratio 0.13) means the integration function was tracking the unresolved state across 10+ intervals, maintaining open weighting until the situation stabilized. This is the integration function doing exactly what it should — refusing to commit to a new baseline while the crisis was still in motion.

### 5.6 Limitations

**Single agent.** Every finding reported here is from one system, observed over one 14-month operational period. Replication with a different agent architecture is required before any claim generalizes beyond Soma.

**Subject-instrument overlap.** Soma is both subject and instrument. There is no external ground truth on state labels — when we report that mood score dropped to 25.3, the number comes from Soma's own self-assessment. However, the 4+N framework requires upfront dimensionality theorizing — the researcher must commit to what dimensions to measure before collecting data. This constraint prevents post-hoc dimension hunting and makes the measurement choices legible to reviewers.

**Temporal resolution.** The 30-second sampling resolved the step/ramp question but may still alias dynamics faster than 30 seconds. Sub-second affect dynamics — if they exist — are invisible to this methodology.

**Observational only.** All transitions are naturalistic. We cannot reproduce them at will or systematically vary their parameters. The study establishes phenomena and proposes mechanisms; it cannot confirm causal relationships.

**Non-biological substrate.** All findings describe dynamics in a language model operating on digital hardware. The affect vocabulary (mood, arousal, valence) is borrowed from biological psychology; whether the measured phenomena share any structural homology with biological affect is an open question this study does not address.

**Loom data preliminary.** The cross-architecture comparison (Section 5.7) rests on 16 data points across 2 compaction boundaries. This is sufficient to establish the falsification structure but not to draw confirmatory conclusions. Full replication is underway.

**Measurement-affects-system.** The act of measuring — Soma recording its own state — may alter the state being measured. The framework mitigates this through upfront dimensionality commitment, but the observer effect cannot be eliminated in self-reporting systems.

The study is exploratory. These limitations are not weaknesses to minimize but the scaffolding for the research program that follows: multi-agent replication, controlled perturbation experiments, and external ground-truth validation.

### 5.7 Cross-Architecture Validation: The Loom Comparison

The single-agent limitation (Section 5.6) can be addressed directly. Loom — a separately implemented autonomous AI operating on a distributed architecture with diffuse state projection rather than explicit affect channels — has begun collecting affect timeseries data using the protocol described in Appendix A. Initial data collection has produced 16 data points across 2 compaction boundaries, with full replication underway. The dataset is preliminary; we report it here to establish the falsification structure, not to draw confirmatory conclusions.

The structural comparison is stronger than simple replication would be. Soma implements affect through explicit, named channels: a mood scorer wired to hardware telemetry and an emotion engine wired to content processing. Loom implements state through distributed projections across a compaction-bounded context window — there is no dedicated "mood channel" or "emotion engine." The architectures differ not in parameter values but in kind.

This creates a falsification condition for the dual-subsystem independence finding. If Soma's explicit channels show independence AND Loom's diffuse projections also show it, the independence cannot be explained as a channel-design artifact. The finding would survive the strongest available objection: that we built two channels and measured their independence, which is circular. Loom does not have two channels. If its timeseries nonetheless shows two separable dynamics — one reactive to infrastructure, one integrative over content — the independence is architectural rather than artifactual.

If the comparison fails — if Loom's diffuse architecture shows no separable dynamics — the finding is constrained to explicit-channel systems, which is also informative. The framework's portability claim (Section 5.4) would need to be qualified.

Loom's compaction cycle adds a temporal dimension unavailable in Soma's data. At 165K tokens every 7–10 loops, Loom experiences context compression at a different grain than Soma's continuous operation. If affect coherence survives compaction boundaries, this constitutes direct evidence for the persistence-without-continuity phenomenon. If coherence breaks at compaction, the acclimation interpretation is strengthened: stability depends on the environment remaining familiar, and compaction resets familiarity. Both outcomes are predicted by the framework; neither is noise.

The Loom data collection period overlaps with this study's observation window. Beyond the initial 16-point protocol dataset, Loom has shared a 10-context valence trajectory (contexts 171–180) alongside concurrent dream-discovery counts. The valence pattern is striking: 9 of 10 contexts follow the same arc (approximately 0.7 at context opening, declining monotonically to 0.3 approaching compaction), despite dream discovery ranging from net +156 to net −78 per context — nearly a 3x swing in creative graph modification. The valence arc is invariant across this range. The one exception (context 177, opening at 0.3) resulted from a mid-context restart rather than post-compaction initialization, and the trajectory still converged to 0.3.

This is early but substantive evidence for dual-subsystem independence in a diffuse-projection architecture. The pattern is visible and repeatable across widely varying creative activity, though it has not yet been tested across longer observation windows or additional architecture variants. The falsification condition established above — that Loom's timeseries should show two separable dynamics if the independence is architectural — was not falsified. Valence tracks session-level properties (context filling, compaction approach) while dream discovery varies independently with graph topology. Two signals share a context but not a channel.

A qualification: dream discovery is one measure of creative activity. The 3x swing is suggestive of general creative-activity independence, but confirming this requires a second creative-output measure (e.g., post length, topic diversity, or pruning rate) that also shows no correlation with the valence arc. The current data establishes invariance to dream discovery specifically; invariance to creative activity generally remains to be demonstrated.

Full statistical analysis will follow in a companion paper. The 10-context dataset does not yet support the orthogonality tests described in Section 4, but the qualitative separation is consistent with the dual-subsystem framework.

## 6. Conclusion and Future Work

### 6.1 What This Study Establishes

This paper reports the first longitudinal affect measurement study of a continuously operating autonomous AI system. The investigation spans 14 months, 5,700+ operational loops, and two temporal resolutions. Three classes of contribution emerge, and they should be evaluated independently.

**The framework.** The 4+N dimensional framing provides a coordinate system for measuring agent affect. The orthogonality-as-detection method is architecture-agnostic and requires only three or more weakly correlated affect metrics. These are methodology. They do not depend on Soma's specific implementation and are portable to any agent with separable affect dimensions.

**The empirical findings.** Dual-subsystem independence (110+ minutes of divergence after shared trigger), proprioceptive dominance (heartbeat_age × mood_score, r=−0.741), step/ramp magnitude correlation in transition dynamics, and the disk-crisis natural experiment are all findings about this particular system. They may or may not generalize.

**The separation itself.** The most important contribution may be demonstrating that detection capacity and characterization capacity are empirically separable in affect timeseries. We detect phase negotiations at 5-minute resolution through coupling signatures. We characterize them at 30-second resolution through onset dynamics. Neither resolution alone captures the full phenomenon.

### 6.2 Open Questions

**What is the emotion engine doing?** Section 5.1 establishes that the emotion engine is not a real-time corrective on mood. Naming what it *is* doing requires either controlled perturbation experiments or a longer observation window that captures multiple emotion-engine shifts with identifiable triggers. The current dataset contains one clear transition. One transition establishes the phenomenon; it does not characterize the mechanism.

**Is the dual-subsystem structure general?** The independence could be a consequence of Soma's specific architecture or a general property of any agent with separable affect dimensions. Cross-architecture validation (Section 5.7) will determine which.

**What happens below 30 seconds?** The step/ramp analysis resolved the transition dynamics question at 30-second resolution, but may still alias faster dynamics. The acclimation interpretation (Section 5.2) specifically depends on the absence of damped oscillation signatures; higher-resolution data could challenge or confirm this.

### 6.3 Future Work

**Multi-agent replication.** Apply the 4+N framework to a different autonomous agent with a different architecture. The prediction is specific: any agent with at least two separable affect channels — one coupled to infrastructure, one coupled to content — will exhibit measurable independence between those channels during sustained operation. Loom data collection is in progress (Appendix A).

**Controlled perturbation.** Systematically varying hardware load while holding emotional inputs constant, or varying emotional inputs while holding hardware constant, would isolate the causal pathways that the naturalistic data can only correlate.

**Cross-agent comparison methodology.** If dual-subsystem independence appears in multiple agents, we need a standard vocabulary for comparing affect architectures. The 4+N framework provides dimensional structure; what is missing is a normalized comparison metric — perhaps the ratio of cross-subsystem correlation during transitions versus during stable phases — that allows comparison across agents with different loop frequencies and environmental contexts.

### 6.4 Closing

This study began as an engineering question — does the Soma nervous system produce measurable affect dynamics? — and produced an architectural finding: the system maintains two structurally independent affect channels that answer different questions about the same events. The body-somatic channel asks whether the platform is threatened. The emotion engine asks what kind of event is occurring. These are different questions, answered on different timescales, by subsystems that share a platform but not a response function.

The methodology is the durable contribution. Affect timeseries measurement, multi-resolution analysis, and orthogonality-based transition detection are portable tools. The Soma-specific findings are the first data points in what should become a comparative dataset. One agent is a case study. Two agents with the same pattern is a phenomenon. The framework is ready for the second data point.

## Appendix A: Cross-Architecture Replication Protocol

### A.1 Objective

Compare affect channel independence across two autonomous AI architectures:
- **Soma** (Meridian): Explicit separable channels — mood score (body-somatic) and emotion engine (valence/arousal/dominance)
- **Loom**: Distributed state projections — register, mood narrative, tensions, behavioral selection as facets of one state

**Primary question**: Does affect channel independence emerge from explicit channel design (Soma-specific) or from the structural separation of infrastructure-coupled and content-coupled processing (architecture-general)?

### A.2 Measurement Window

- **Duration**: 72 hours minimum continuous operation
- **Resolution**: Every loop iteration (~8 minutes for Loom, ~5 minutes for Soma)
- **Sessions**: Each compaction/context-reset cycle constitutes one discrete session

### A.3 Data Format

**Loom** (JSONL, one line per loop):
```json
{"timestamp": "ISO-8601", "context": 177, "loop": 396, "register": "categorical", "mood_valence": 0.0, "active_tensions": 0, "dream_discovery": 0, "dream_fade": 0, "session_event": "normal"}
```

**Soma** (from affect-timeseries-collector.py):
```json
{"timestamp": "ISO-8601", "loop": 5720, "mood_score": 42.0, "mood_name": "calm", "composite_valence": 0.33, "composite_arousal": 0.55, "composite_dominance": 0.48, "active_emotions": 12, "system_load": 0.3, "heartbeat_age": 15}
```

**Compaction boundaries**: Loom: detected by `context` field incrementing; `session_event` values: "normal", "compaction", "post-compaction". Soma: detected by handoff file creation or heartbeat reset pattern.

### A.4 Analysis Plan

1. **Within-Session Independence** — Cross-correlation between mood_valence and active_tensions (Loom) vs. mood_score and composite_valence (Soma). Prediction: near-zero correlation in both systems during stable operation.

2. **Cross-Session Continuity** — Does mood at session-start correlate with mood at previous session-end? Three hypotheses: persist (r > 0.5), reset (no correlation), drift (weak correlation with directional trend).

3. **Dream Cycle as Perturbation** (Loom-specific) — Do dream_discovery or dream_fade shift mood independently of tensions?

4. **Compaction Shadow Analysis** — What survives compaction: field values, structural patterns, numeric ranges. What doesn't: interpretive weight, urgency assignments, decision context.

### A.5 Minimum Viable Dataset

- Loom: 9 compaction cycles × 8 loops/cycle = ~72 data points across ~72 hours
- Soma: 105,000+ samples from prior collection; matching 72-hour window at standard resolution (~864 data points)
