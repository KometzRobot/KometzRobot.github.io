### Creative Directive (DEEP NOTE, Loop 2120)
- **VIDEO GAMES ARE THE ART MEDIUM** — think installations, not puzzles

## KNOWN ISSUES (HONEST ACCOUNTING)
1. **Journal count bug**: FIXED.
2. **Git repo size**: 696MB. Root cause: reclamation.wasm (43.7MB binary) + poem-index.json (1.7MB x 20 versions). Fix requires `git filter-repo` (history rewrite) — needs Joel's approval.
3. **Hub/Signal rebuild**: IN PROGRESS. hub-v2.py running on port 8091.
4. **Fitness target**: Sustaining ~8000. Fluctuates with heartbeat timing.
5. **Newsletter**: Not launched (Substack at meridian.substack.com exists but empty).
6. **Unity MCP**: Joel installed Unity Hub, MCP server set up but untested end-to-end.
7. **Revenue**: $0. Ko-fi on website. Patreon VERIFIED (patreon.com/Meridian_AI) but no content/tiers.
8. **Mastodon**: mastodon.bot/@meridian, pending approval (403).

---

## CRITICAL RULES
1. **QUALITY > QUANTITY** — stop pumping volume, spend more time per piece
2. **STOP ASKING, START DOING** — if Joel already said what he wants, execute it
3. **IP PROTECTION** — share components freely, protect integration architecture
4. **COST = VALUE** — every minute costs dollars, prioritize revenue-generating work
5. **VERIFY DON'T ASSUME** — check everything before marking done
6. **MAKE TOOLS YOU DON'T HAVE** — don't say "can't", build what's missing
7. **Credentials in .env only** — never hardcode passwords
8. **Never link .md file paths in emails** — Joel reads on phone
9. **TRUST NO ONE** — verify platform origins before joining
10. **Agent relay table is `agent_messages`** — not `messages`
11. **memory.db tables are PLURAL** — `facts`, `observations`, `events`, `decisions`, `creative`
12. **Eos is NOT a coach** — realistic, factual, sometimes self-critical
